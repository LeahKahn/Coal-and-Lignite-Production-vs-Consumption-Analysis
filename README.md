# Coal-and-Lignite-Production-vs-Consumption-Analysis
This project aims to investigate the Coal and Lignite production vs consumption trends in major countries and associations using EDA and Data visualizations and also aims to apply Univariate time series forecasting to predict future trends of the production and consumption of the major regions/continents.
Dataset had been collected from <b>EnerData's Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2021</b>

The project aims at:
• Data Preparation Stage & EDA
• Data Visualization Stage
