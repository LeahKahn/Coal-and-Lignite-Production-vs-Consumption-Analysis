# Coal-and-Lignite-Production-vs-Consumption-Analysis
This project aims to investigate the Coal and Lignite production vs consumption trends in major countries and associations using EDA and Data visualizations and also aims to apply Univariate time series forecasting to predict future trends of the production and consumption of the major regions/continents.
Dataset had been collected from <b>EnerData's Global Energy Statistical Yearbook 2021</b>

The project aims at:
• Data Preparation Stage & EDA
• Data Visualization Stage
• Comparison
• Time Series forecasting for Large Regions

Data Visualization for Coal production and consumption for Large regions/continents:

The univariate Time Series Forecasting has been crried out using ARIMA Model. Below is a peek of <b>Model Analysis for Asia's Consumption Trend</b> and <b>Asia's Consumption Forecast from 2021-2045</b><br><br>

This project helps to see the differences and trends in the Production and Consumption of Coal and Lignite for all the regions through Data Visualization and ARIMA model helps predict the trends that will follow in the future years with the help of insights from the past years' data.
